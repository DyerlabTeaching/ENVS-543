## The Rubric

All homework will turned in by publishing a Quarto document to your GitHub account. See either the online [GitHub Pages Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) or the module in your course that covered GitHub integration for how to do this.  The following rubric will be used in the course CANVAS site (denoted as `Online Homework Rubric` there) to evaluate the scores of each homework assignment using the following general criteria.  Since this rubric applies to a series of homework assignents, you should quickly become familiar with the requirements to gain full marks.
