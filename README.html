<h1><a href="https://dyerlabteaching.github.io/ENVS543-Fall_2023/index.html">ENVS 543: Environmental Data Literacy</a> Fall 2023</h1>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Semester course; 3 lecture hours. 3 credits. Enrollment is restricted to students with graduate standing or those with one course in statistics and permission of instructor. Develop quantitative skills for the visualization, manipulation, analysis, and communication of environmental “big data.” This course focuses on spatial environmental data analysis, interpretation, and communication, using real-time data from the Rice Rivers Center and the R statistical analysis environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img align="right" src="media/dyer.png"> Hello. My name is Dr.&nbsp;Rodney Dyer and this is a course I’ve developed to serve as the entry course for incoming Environmental Studies graduate students and advanced undergraduates.</p>
<p>The rationale for this class is as follows.</p>
<p>As both a student and instructor in statistics classes, I found I spent a vast amount of time and effort describing the characteristics of statistics (derivations, expectations, etc.). This is perfectly fine, it is important on many levels to make sure that practitioners understand the basis and context of all the kinds of analyses they use. However, the drawback here, in my experience, is that once you’ve spent a semester or year getting all this knowledge under your belt, and one can easily demonstrate their understanding of the parameters in a model, they cannot actually work with real data. This class is designed to produce practitioners of data analysis.</p>
<section id="workflow-in-data-analysis" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="workflow-in-data-analysis">Workflow in Data Analysis</h2>
<p>To understand data analytics, one needs to recognize the entire workflow. Below is a brief graphical depiction of how analysis actually works—in the real world. In this class, we will work on all of these components using the open-source R language.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Collect:</strong> Getting data from an external source into a format that you can use is often the most time-consuming step in the analysis. The content of this class will provide training in data import from local, online, and database sources.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Visualize:</strong> Visualizing data is key to understanding. In the image below, notice that the variables X and Y in all the displayed data sets have equivalent means, standard deviations, and correlation up to 2 decimal places! We will emphasize visualization, both static and dynamic, throughout this class.</li>
<li><strong>Transform:</strong> Pulling data into your analysis ecosystem is not sufficient. Often the data need to be reformatted and reconfigured before it is actually usable.</li>
<li><strong>Model:</strong> The application of models to subsets of data is often the step that takes the least amount of time and effort. However, the application of a model to data is not the endpoint. The model must be visualized and, many times, the underlying data or derivate data must be transformed and submitted to subsequent models.</li>
<li><strong>Communicate:</strong> The effort we put into research and analyses is meaningless without effective communication of your data and findings to a broad audience. Here we will focus on how to develop effective data communication strategies and formats.</li>
</ul>

<section id="learning-objectives" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="learning-objectives">Learning Objectives</h2>
<p>The purpose of this course is to help you build your data skills and to develop a foundational understanding upon which subsequent courses will build. The overarching goal here is to develop a working knowledge of the R statistical computing language and enough proficiency to import raw data and then iterate through the visualization, manipulation, and analysis steps in the creation of output that is easily communicated to a scientific audience.</p>
<p>The content of this course is built upon the following general Ctudent Learning Objectives (CLO):</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Use R to perform reproducible data analysis workflows across environmental contexts:</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Students will demonstrate functional fluency in using R and its associated libraries (e.g., Tidyverse, Quarto) for data import, transformation, visualization, and analysis, establishing a generalizable skillset for quantitative inquiry.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><em>Bloom’s Level:</em> Apply/Analyze.</li>
<li><em>Notes:</em> This aligns with the practical literacy needed to “think with data” in a coding environment. It emphasizes generalized fluency over memorization or syntax drills. Modules like “Data Types &amp; Containers,” “Tidyverse,” “Markdown &amp; Quarto,” and “Graphics that Don’t Suck” all serve this CLO.<br>
</li>
<li><em>Reinforces:</em> Students seeing R as a tool for thinking and doing, not just syntax or statistics.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><strong>Analyze and interpret common environmental datasets using appropriate exploratory and statistical techniques:</strong> Students will apply foundational exploratory and statistical approaches (e.g., binomial models, contingency tables, regression, spatial summaries) to common ecological, environmental, and evolutionary datasets to support data-driven inference.</li>
</ol>

<section id="course-content-assessment" class="level2">

<p>VCU is committed to ensuring that all students maintain equal access to all aspects of the university, including educational experiences through the provision of reasonable accommodations and academic adjustments. In addition to being a requirement under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act, this speaks directly to VCU’s mission of inclusion, equity, and access. To receive accommodations or other disability-related supports, students must register with the Office of Student Accessibility and Educational Opportunity on the Monroe Park Campus (828-2253) or the Division for Academic Success on the MCV campus (828-9782). Students and faculty can visit the <a href="https://saeo.vcu.edu/">Student Accessibility and Educational Opportunity website</a> and/or the <a href="https://das.vcu.edu/">Division for Academic Success website</a> for additional information. Once students have completed the registration process, they will be provided with a letter of accommodation.

<p>The instructional programs at VCU are based upon a series of class meetings involving lectures, discussions, field experiences, special readings, and reporting assignments. Therefore it is important for each student to be in attendance on a regular basis. A student who misses a class session is responsible for completing all material covered or assignments made during the absence.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Students having attendance problems should contact their instructor to explain the reasons for nonattendance and to discuss the feasibility of continuing in the course. If the student has fallen so far behind that the successful completion of the course is impossible, the student should withdraw from the course before the end of the first 10 weeks of classes (by Oct.&nbsp;28, 2022).</p></li>
<li><p>If the student continues to miss class and does not officially withdraw from the course, the instructor may withdraw the student for nonattendance with a mark of “W’’ before the end of the first 10 weeks of classes or may assign an academic grade at the end. Withdrawals are not permitted after the end of the first 10 weeks of classes.

<p>VCU instructional faculty, administrators, and staff maintain confidentiality of student records and disclose information in accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). This means that VCU officials may disclose student record information without the consent of the student in certain situations. To support university operations, for example, VCU officials share information about students with other educational officials as necessary to perform their job duties. FERPA permits this disclosure to school officials who have a legitimate educational interest in the student information. In addition, VCU officials have obligations to report information shared by a student depending on the content of that information, for example, in compliance with VCU’s policy on the duty to report. Unless FERPA permits a certain disclosure, VCU generally requires consent from a student to disclose information from their education record to another individual. You may find additional information on the <a href="https://rar.vcu.edu/records/family-educational-rights-and-privacy-act/">VCU FERPA website.</a></p>
